# LSTM-Neural-Network
This project was done as part of my CS6375 Machine Learning course

Implemented an LSTM Neural Network from scratch which can be used to forecast time series data. The model was tested using US baby names dataset.


1. Run the RNN_LSTM.py file 
2. It will prompt you to enter the number of epochs to make, where you can enter your desired number of epochs.
3. After training is complete, it will prompt you to enter the desired number of future names to predict and predicts the entered number of names.
